A **(1 + ε) Approximate Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** is a version of the MST that’s almost optimal. Instead of finding the exact MST, it finds a tree whose total weight is at most **(1 + ε) times** the weight of the true MST, where **ε** is a small positive value like 0.1 or 0.01.

### Why it’s useful:

It runs **faster** than the exact MST algorithms, especially for large graphs.
It’s useful in **real-time systems** or **streaming models**, where we can’t afford slow computations.
It’s good when **approximate answers are acceptable**, like in networking or graphics.

### Key idea:

By slightly relaxing the optimality condition, we save time and still get a very close-to-best result.

A (1+ε)-approximate MST trades a little accuracy for much better speed and efficiency.
